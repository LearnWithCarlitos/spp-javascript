# Summary

- This repository was created with the intention of facilitating the understanding of the JavaScript programming language, in addition to practicing our programming logic.

# IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY!

- In the "base" folder it will solve programming problems. Community content from third parties, YouTubers, platforms, repositories, etc. will be used. Therefore, out of respect for the original authors and for the sake of readers. I will put a segment of text where you will find the information, it will include the sources, resources and bibliographies that I used to find and solve these exercises at the end of each exercise.

- I CLARIFY: I DO NOT CREATE THE EXERCISES, I ONLY SOLVE THE EXERCISES.

# General Objective

- Practice and learn JavaScript

# Specific Objectives

- Solve programming exercises proposed by the community or third parties.

# Methodology

- As a proposed solution for specific objective 1 (Simply publish the progress of the roadmap in PDF or image).

- As a proposed solution for specific objective 2 (Will be addressed in the "javascript" subfolder).

- As a proposed solution for specific objective 3 (Will be addressed in the "base" subfolder. I want to achieve this specific objective in a solution format, and I believe it should be done this way).

    - Requirements
    - Flowchart (Optional)
    - Code

# Additional Information

 - The repository has a default configuration for your convenience, which you only need to install with the "npm install" command, but if you want you can delete or ignore the configuration and be left with only the content of the exercises. Which is in the "src" folder.

 - the repository has an automated script in .bat format that will allow you to execute commands that will help you with the presentation, order and code problems. (if you get confused or don't know what they are for, you can use ChatGPT to explain it to you)
